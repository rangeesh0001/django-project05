            Online banking allows you to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of online banking you can access through a computer or app.
            Banking transactions offered online vary by institution. Most banks generally offer basic services such as transfers and bill payments. Some banks also allow customers to open up new accounts and apply for credit cards through online banking portals. Other functions may include ordering checks, putting stop payments on checks, or reporting a change of address.
            Checks can be deposited online through a mobile app using remote deposit capture. Enter the check amount, then use the app to take a photo of the front and back of the check to complete the deposit.
